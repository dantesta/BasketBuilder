# Basket Builder - Project 3

Project 3 - Build a Gift Basket

1. Our overall application's concept

    The idea is to build a website where you can create your own gift basket. The site will prompt you through a series of steps that allow you to choose a container and the items inside of it. After each item is chosen, it will be added to the cart that will update with each new item added. In order to create a basket you will need to create an account and login. We plan to use either mongo or MySQL to store this data. Users can also choose from an assortment of pre-built baskets that can be purchased without having to create an account. The goal behind this idea is to make a functional e-commerce website using all the concepts we have learned thus far. 

2. Our motivation for this project

    Our motivation is not necassarily create something that does not already exist rather to challenge ourselves with a concept that has many real world applications that will help us with our future careers. As far as how we are going to split the work, we have yet to decide who will be working on what. We will likely follow the same route we took for project 2 and allow everyone to work on their areas of strength. Our goal is to have a minimum viable product by the end of week 2 (Jan 8th).
